# Blanket (blankie-mode)

Redesign of the original Blanket skin. The old version was more of a proof of
concept than anything and turned out to be a pain to work with, so starting
again from scratch appeared to be the better solution.

## Planned features

* Fully customisable three pane system (left, centre, right), similar to the
    two pane system old blanket had but better.
* Each pane is customisable separately instead of everything being thrown in
    one "Custom Widget" table.
* Pane presets are still a thing.
* Dark mode.
* Proper localisation for the relevant skin elements.
* Localisation for (some) table names.
* Modular system in place for defining widgets each confined to their own
    subfolder (will make it easier on me to work on this, and also allow for
    people to create their own widgets easily!).

Here's how you can currently expect the next version of blanket to look:
